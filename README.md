# ðŸ§© LogicGNN: Graph Neural Networks with Rule-Based Explanations

This repository provides an experimental framework for training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and extracting interpretable logic-based rules from their predictions. It combines standard GNN architectures with decision treeâ€“based explanations and orbit-based grounding.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Multiple GNN backbones:
  - **GCN**, **GIN**, **GAT**, **GraphSAGE**
- Wide range of datasets:
  - **Molecule datasets**: BBBP, Mutagenicity, NCI1  
  - **Synthetic**: BAMultiShapes  
  - **Social**: IMDB-BINARY, Reddit, Twitch, GitHub stargazers
- Explanation modules:
  - Extract intermediate activations from GNN layers
  - Fit surrogate **Decision Trees** for interpretability
  - Subgraph grounding with orbit decomposition and predicate extraction
- Training utilities:
  - Class-balanced weights
  - Checkpoint saving/loading
  - Early stopping thresholds per dataset

## ðŸ›  Usage

### Training a Model
```bash
python main.py --dataset BBBP --arch GCN --seed 42
```
Arguments

--dataset: one of BBBP, Mutagenicity, IMDB-BINARY, NCI1, BAMultiShapes, reddit_threads, twitch_egos, github_stargazers

--arch: one of GCN, GIN, GAT, GraphSAGE

--seed: random seed (default: 0)

--load: load a pretrained model

--max_depth: maximum depth for decision tree explanations
Example

Train a GIN on Mutagenicity:
``` bash
python main.py --dataset Mutagenicity --arch GIN --seed 1
```
ðŸ“Š Explanation Pipeline
